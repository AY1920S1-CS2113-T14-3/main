== Introduction

WordUp (WU) is a desktop-based application for english language learners who prefer having a digital version of a personal vocabulary booklet (otherwise known as a word bank). More importantly, WU is great for on-the-go revision, which is not easily achieved with traditional hardcopy word banks. WU provides convenience and efficiency of adding words in a word bank, and allows users to manage their word collection faster with a Command Line Interface (CLI), as well as having a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for more interactive functions and for better visualisation of content stored.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `wordup.jar` https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113-T14-3/main/releases/tag/v1.3[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your WordUp.
.  Ensure that you have `JavaFX` installed.
.  [Windows] Open command prompt by typing cmd in the start bar. 
.  Enter the following command: `java --module-path [path to javafx lib folder]C:\Java\javafx-sdk-11.0.2\lib --add-modules=javafx.controls -jar [path to home folder of WordUp]C:\home\wordup-v1.3.jar`
.  If you encounter a module not found error, please check that you do not have a spacing in your file path to `javafx\lib`. 
.  Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing `help` and pressing `Enter` opens up the window showing a list of commands available. +
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : shows the list of words currently stored in the Word Bank in alphabetical displayOrder or otherwise customised in the app settings
* **`add`**`w/life m/the existence of an individual human being or animal` : adds a word tagged by “w/” with its corresponding meaning tagged “m/” into the Word Bank
* **`delete`**`w/freedom` : deletes the Word Bank entry of the word “freedom”
* *`exit`* : exits the application

.  Refer to <<Features>> for in-depth details for more commands.
